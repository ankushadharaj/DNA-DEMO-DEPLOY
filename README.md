# DNA-DEMO-DEPLOY
The project is about developing an interactive Android/iOS app which takes a scribble as an input from the user and returns a list of organisms with DNA sequence that closely matches the input scribble. The app is developed as an powerful, interactive tool to demo the newly developed DNA sequencer device to the public in a fun and interesting manner.
